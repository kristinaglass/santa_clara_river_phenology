# Santa Clara River Phenology
## About
The purpose of this study is to investigate plant phenology of riparian forests, grasslands, and chaparral shrub lands along the Santa Clara River. Riparian forests grow along the river and are dominated by winter deciduous cottonwood and willow trees, grasslands grow in open spaces and are predominate dominated by deciduous grasses, and chaparral shrub lands grow in more arid areas and are dominated by evergreen shrubs.

We will explore the vegetation productivity (NDVI), calculate the NDVI throughout the year, summarize the NDVI values within vegetation communities, and visualize the changes in NDVI within vegetation communities.

## Data and References
Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI sensor) which contains 8 pre-processed scenes. The attributes of the scenes are as follows:

Level 2 surface reflectance products

erroneous values were set to NA

Scale factor set to 100

Bands are 2-7

Dates of the scenes are in file name

and

Study sites which are polygons that represent the sites of interest. The attributes are as follows:

"study_site" is a character string with plant type

The data are available in a folder labeled "data" within the repository
